# Computational-Diagnostics-of-Data
A basic understanding of the definition and the meaning of computational diagnostics and its utility for data science. Case studies illustrating the interplay between computational and statistical methods that are applied to data sets from genomic experiments and business processes. 
A practical approach such problems by using the statistical programming language R. In general, the course teaches statistical thinking in the context of data-driven problems, i.e., the adaptation of machine learning methods in a problem specific manner. It involves combining elements from ‘computational biology’, ‘business analytics’ and ‘statistical learning’ to form ‘computational diagnostics’.

Topics covered:
1. Introduction to Data Science, general error measures and introduction to R
2. Statistical hypothesis testing & GO
3. High-throughput data from oligo arrays & classification methods
4. Resampling methods
5. Linear regression analysis models
6. Survival analysis
